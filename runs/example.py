    # An announcement...but there's more. Historically the 'skip' and 'name'
    # ('next') information was stored inside of the previous line. For example
    # you might be at CS, your 'skip' would be set to the size of the next
    # area, so you could skip it and be right where you had left off, at CS.
    # The --dash--separated--format-- still works this way. The reason this was
    # moved to the next element in the list was so you could easily reorder
    # areas. Always having the previous move know about the next got tedious
    # when you wanted to move an area about. Now the ', next X' and 'skip' is
    # all self contained. This 'announce' will be expanded to 'CS, next Cyndre'
    # and the 'skip' of 3 will be set on this current line. The summary just
    # says that this is a summary line and it should be printed when dumping
    # with --summary.

    # which is the previous room. That is how you want this to work.
